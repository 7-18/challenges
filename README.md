# challenges

Welcome to the challenges repository! This collection of coding challenges features solutions that utilize recursion instead of loops. Recursion is a powerful technique in programming where a function calls itself to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find a set of coding challenges that have been solved using recursion in various programming languages. Each challenge is placed in its respective folder, and inside each folder, you can find the following files:

- `solution.py`: The solution to the challenge in Python, Kotlin, JavaScript, etc.
- (Optional) `problem.md`: A detailed description of the challenge, including its input, output, and any constraints.
- (Optional) `test.py`: If needed, a separate file with test functions used in the solution.
- (Optional) `DATA.lst`: A list of test data that can be used to solve the challenge.

## Why Recursion?

Recursion is a valuable approach to problem-solving, especially when dealing with tasks that have a recursive nature or can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem. It allows for elegant and concise code that often mirrors the problem's natural structure, making it easier to understand and maintain.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder representing a specific challenge. Inside each challenge folder, you will find the solutions in various programming languages. For example:

```
├── challenge-1
│ ├── problem.md
│ ├── solution.py
│ └── test.py
├── challenge-2
│ ├── problem.md
│ ├── solution.js
│ └── test.js
```

## Getting Started

To explore the solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:7-18/challenges.git
cd challenges
```

2. Navigate to the specific challenge folder you are interested in:

```
cd challenge-name
```

3. Run the following command to run the challenge:

```
cat DATA.lst | language solution.file
```

Disclaimer: the command to run the challenge is not included in the repository.
